[ ] Calls: consolidate push, pop, en to en, sel
[ ] reduce instruction cycles where possible since rom has 1 cycle latency
[ ]   rom data arrives one cycle + ~100ps and a full cycle is wasted because of that
[ ]     try adding a delay of 1ns in the always block
[ ]   ldi data can be loaded into register in a single cycle 
[ ] consider making rom 64K and ram 32K to represent a retro computer with 64K program cartige
